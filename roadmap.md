# Roadmap: Queen Puzzle Game in React Native

## Project Overview
The Queen Puzzle Game is inspired by the classic "8 Queens Puzzle," where players must place 8 queens on a chessboard such that no two queens threaten each other. The game involves strategic placement on a visual chessboard with drag-and-drop mechanics.

---

## Goals
1. Create an interactive chessboard UI.
2. Implement drag-and-drop functionality for placing queens.
3. Validate the queen placement according to chess rules (no conflicts in rows, columns, or diagonals).
4. Add animations and sound effects for a polished experience.
5. Provide hints or allow undo actions for user assistance.

## Development Phases

### Phase 1: âœ… **Project Setup** (COMPLETED)
1. âœ… **Set up React Native Environment**:
   - âœ… Ensure Node.js, npm, and React Native CLI are installed.
   - âœ… Initialize the project: `npx react-native init QueenPuzzleGame`.
   - âœ… Set up testing devices/emulators for both iOS and Android.
   
2. âœ… **Install Dependencies**:
   - âœ… UI Library: `react-native-paper` or `react-native-elements`.
   - âœ… Drag-and-Drop Library: `react-native-draggable`.
   - âœ… State Management: `redux` or `@reduxjs/toolkit` for global game state.
   - âœ… Optional Animations: `react-native-reanimated`.

3. âœ… **Define Basic Folder Structure**:
   ```
   /src
   â”œâ”€â”€ components
   â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ Chessboard.js
   â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ Queen.js
   â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ Header.js
   â”‚   â””â”€â”€ GameControls.js
   â”œâ”€â”€ screens
   â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ HomeScreen.js
   â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ GameScreen.js
   â”‚   â””â”€â”€ ResultScreen.js
   â”œâ”€â”€ styles
   â”‚   â””â”€â”€ styles.js
   â”œâ”€â”€ redux
   â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ slices
   â”‚   â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ gameSlice.js
   â”‚   â””â”€â”€ store.js
   â””â”€â”€ utils
       â”œâ”€â”€ validation.js
       â””â”€â”€ constants.js
   ```

### Phase 2: ðŸš§ **Color Region Queens Puzzle** (IN PROGRESS)
1. **Enhanced Board Design**:
   - Create colored regions on the board (each region with unique color).
   - For 9x9 board, design 9 distinct regions with different shapes and sizes.
   - Ensure colors are visually distinguishable and accessibility-friendly.

2. **Region Generation System**:
   - Implement a random region generation algorithm:
     - Start with random seed points on the board
     - Use flood-fill or growth algorithms to expand regions
     - Ensure each region has 9 squares (for 9x9 board)
   - Region Shape Requirements:
     - Regions can be irregular shapes
     - All squares in a region must be connected
     - Support various patterns: L-shapes, T-shapes, zigzags, etc.
     - Allow regions to wrap around other regions
   - Region Generation Controls:
     - Set minimum/maximum region size
     - Control region complexity (simple vs intricate shapes)
     - Ensure generated patterns are solvable

3. **Region Management**:
   - Create a data structure to map squares to their respective regions
   - Implement region validation and connectivity checks
   - Store region patterns for replay or sharing
   - Add difficulty rating system based on region complexity

4. **Updated Game Logic**:
   - Modify validation to include region-based rules:
     - Only one queen per region regardless of shape
     - Maintain existing row/column/diagonal constraints
   - Track placed queens by both position and region
   - Add special validation for wrapped regions

5. **UI Enhancements for Regions**:
   - Add visual distinction between adjacent irregular regions
   - Implement hover effects that highlight entire irregular regions
   - Show region completion status
   - Add visual feedback for invalid placements
   - Animate region generation process (optional)

6. **Difficulty Levels Based on Region Shapes**:
   - Easy: Regular, rectangular regions
   - Medium: Simple L-shapes and T-shapes
   - Hard: Complex irregular shapes with wrapping
   - Expert: Highly irregular patterns with minimal region size differences

7. **Region Pattern Management**:
   - Save interesting region patterns
   - Allow sharing of region patterns via codes
   - Generate daily challenges with unique region layouts
   - Create a rating system for pattern difficulty

### Phase 3: **Gameplay Enhancements**
1. **Game Logic**:
   - Add functionality to track the number of placed queens.
   - Determine win/lose conditions:
     - Win: All 8 queens are placed without conflicts.
     - Lose: Player attempts exceed a limit (optional).

2. **Hints & Undo**:
   - Allow players to get a hint for valid queen placement (optional).
   - Implement undo functionality to remove the last placed queen.

3. **Game Controls**:
   - Add buttons for "Reset," "Hint," and "Undo."

4. **Game Feedback**:
   - Display messages for win/lose scenarios.
   - Add animations and sound effects for actions.

---

### Phase 4: **UI/UX Enhancements**
1. **Polish Chessboard UI**:
   - Add hover effects on squares for better interactivity.
   - Highlight valid placement squares dynamically.

2. **Add Animations**:
   - Use `react-native-reanimated` for smooth transitions.
   - Animate queen placement and validation errors.

3. **Sound Effects**:
   - Play sounds for actions like placing a queen, invalid moves, and winning.

4. **Responsive Design**:
   - Ensure the UI looks great on various screen sizes and orientations.

---

### Phase 5: **Testing & Optimization**
1. **Unit Testing**:
   - Use `jest` and `react-native-testing-library` to test validation logic and components.

2. **Performance Optimization**:
   - Optimize re-renders with `React.memo` and `useCallback`.
   - Test drag-and-drop responsiveness on low-end devices.

3. **Bug Fixes**:
   - Test edge cases (e.g., fast multiple moves, invalid placements).

---

### Phase 6: **Deployment**
1. **Build for Production**:
   - Generate release builds for Android (`.apk/.aab`) and iOS (`.ipa`).
   - Test on real devices.

2. **App Store Submission**:
   - Prepare app metadata, icons, and screenshots.
   - Publish on Google Play Store and Apple App Store.

---

### Future Features
- Add difficulty levels (e.g., increase grid size or number of queens).
- Include a leaderboard to rank players by completion time.
- Introduce multiplayer or competitive modes.
- Add a tutorial for new players.
- Generate custom region patterns using AI/algorithms
- Allow players to create and share their own region patterns
- Add a daily challenge with unique region layouts
- Implement a hint system that considers both classic rules and region constraints
