# Roadmap: Queen Puzzle Game in React Native

## Project Overview
The Queen Puzzle Game is inspired by the classic "8 Queens Puzzle," where players must place 8 queens on a chessboard such that no two queens threaten each other. The game involves strategic placement on a visual chessboard with drag-and-drop mechanics.

---

## Goals
1. Create an interactive chessboard UI.
2. Implement drag-and-drop functionality for placing queens.
3. Validate the queen placement according to chess rules (no conflicts in rows, columns, or diagonals).
4. Add animations and sound effects for a polished experience.
5. Provide hints or allow undo actions for user assistance.

   - âœ… State Management: `redux` or `@reduxjs/toolkit` for global game state.
   - âœ… Optional Animations: `react-native-reanimated`.

3. âœ… **Define Basic Folder Structure**:
   ```
   /src
   â”œâ”€â”€ components
   â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ Chessboard.js

   â”‚   â””â”€â”€ ResultScreen.js
   â”œâ”€â”€ styles
   â”‚   â””â”€â”€ styles.js
   â”œâ”€â”€ redux
   â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ slices
   â”‚   â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ gameSlice.js
   â”‚   â””â”€â”€ store.js
   â””â”€â”€ utils
       â”œâ”€â”€ validation.js
       â””â”€â”€ constants.js
   ```

### Phase 2: âœ… **Color Region Queens Puzzle** (COMPLETED)
1. âœ… **Enhanced Board Design**:
   - âœ… Created colored regions on the board (each region with unique color)
   - âœ… Implemented 9x9 board with 9 distinct regions
   - âœ… Ensured colors are visually distinguishable and accessibility-friendly

2. âœ… **Region Generation System**:
   - âœ… Implemented random region generation algorithm
   - âœ… Added support for various region shapes and patterns
   - âœ… Implemented connectivity validation

3. âœ… **Region Management**:
   - âœ… Created data structures for region mapping
   - âœ… Implemented validation and connectivity checks
   - âœ… Added pattern storage system

4. âœ… **Updated Game Logic**:
   - âœ… Modified validation for region-based rules
   - âœ… Implemented position and region tracking
   - âœ… Added special validation for wrapped regions

5. âœ… **UI Enhancements for Regions**:
   - âœ… Added visual distinction between regions
   - âœ… Implemented hover effects
   - âœ… Added completion status indicators

6. âœ… **Difficulty Levels**:
   - âœ… Implemented multiple difficulty tiers
