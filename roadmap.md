# Roadmap: Queen Puzzle Game in React Native

## Project Overview
The Queen Puzzle Game is inspired by the classic "8 Queens Puzzle," where players must place 8 queens on a chessboard such that no two queens threaten each other. The game involves strategic placement on a visual chessboard with drag-and-drop mechanics.

---

## Goals
1. Create an interactive chessboard UI.
2. Implement drag-and-drop functionality for placing queens.
3. Validate the queen placement according to chess rules (no conflicts in rows, columns, or diagonals).
4. Add animations and sound effects for a polished experience.
5. Provide hints or allow undo actions for user assistance.

## Development Phases

### Phase 1: **Project Setup**
1. **Set up React Native Environment**:
   - Ensure Node.js, npm, and React Native CLI are installed.
   - Initialize the project: `npx react-native init QueenPuzzleGame`.
   - Set up testing devices/emulators for both iOS and Android.
   
2. **Install Dependencies**:
   - UI Library: `react-native-paper` or `react-native-elements`.
   - Drag-and-Drop Library: `react-native-draggable`.
   - State Management: `redux` or `@reduxjs/toolkit` for global game state.
   - Optional Animations: `react-native-reanimated`.

3. **Define Basic Folder Structure**:
   ```
   /src
   ├── components
   │   ├── Chessboard.js
   │   ├── Queen.js
   │   ├── Header.js
   │   └── GameControls.js
   ├── screens
   │   ├── HomeScreen.js
   │   ├── GameScreen.js
   │   └── ResultScreen.js
   ├── styles
   │   └── styles.js
   ├── redux
   │   ├── slices
   │   │   ├── gameSlice.js
   │   └── store.js
   └── utils
       ├── validation.js
       └── constants.js
   ```

---

### Phase 2: **Build Core Features**
1. **Chessboard UI**:
   - Create an 8x8 grid layout using `FlatList` or `View` components.
   - Style the grid with alternating light/dark squares to mimic a chessboard.

2. **Queen Component**:
   - Design a draggable queen using the `react-native-draggable` library.
   - Add basic styling to represent a queen.

3. **Drag-and-Drop Functionality**:
   - Enable drag-and-drop mechanics to place queens on valid grid positions.
   - Snap the queen to the nearest square after dropping.

4. **Placement Validation**:
   - Implement logic in `validation.js` to check:
     - No queens in the same row or column.
     - No queens in the same diagonal.
   - Provide feedback (e.g., highlight invalid squares).

---

### Phase 3: **Gameplay Enhancements**
1. **Game Logic**:
   - Add functionality to track the number of placed queens.
   - Determine win/lose conditions:
     - Win: All 8 queens are placed without conflicts.
     - Lose: Player attempts exceed a limit (optional).

2. **Hints & Undo**:
   - Allow players to get a hint for valid queen placement (optional).
   - Implement undo functionality to remove the last placed queen.

3. **Game Controls**:
   - Add buttons for "Reset," "Hint," and "Undo."

4. **Game Feedback**:
   - Display messages for win/lose scenarios.
   - Add animations and sound effects for actions.

---

### Phase 4: **UI/UX Enhancements**
1. **Polish Chessboard UI**:
   - Add hover effects on squares for better interactivity.
   - Highlight valid placement squares dynamically.

2. **Add Animations**:
   - Use `react-native-reanimated` for smooth transitions.
   - Animate queen placement and validation errors.

3. **Sound Effects**:
   - Play sounds for actions like placing a queen, invalid moves, and winning.

4. **Responsive Design**:
   - Ensure the UI looks great on various screen sizes and orientations.

---

### Phase 5: **Testing & Optimization**
1. **Unit Testing**:
   - Use `jest` and `react-native-testing-library` to test validation logic and components.

2. **Performance Optimization**:
   - Optimize re-renders with `React.memo` and `useCallback`.
   - Test drag-and-drop responsiveness on low-end devices.

3. **Bug Fixes**:
   - Test edge cases (e.g., fast multiple moves, invalid placements).

---

### Phase 6: **Deployment**
1. **Build for Production**:
   - Generate release builds for Android (`.apk/.aab`) and iOS (`.ipa`).
   - Test on real devices.

2. **App Store Submission**:
   - Prepare app metadata, icons, and screenshots.
   - Publish on Google Play Store and Apple App Store.

---

### Future Features
- Add difficulty levels (e.g., increase grid size or number of queens).
- Include a leaderboard to rank players by completion time.
- Introduce multiplayer or competitive modes.
- Add a tutorial for new players.
